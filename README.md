# Pour Decisions
Pour Decisions is a an app that was made for the cocktail aficionado. With bars being closed for the better part of the past year,
we figured an application that could recommend cocktails based of one's liquor preference, mood, or a random recommendation, is just
what was needed.

 You can view the live application at https://thompsonel11.github.io/Project_1/

## User Story
As a cocktail enthusiast, I want to be presented with different cocktail recipes so that I can conveniently make a cocktail based on:
```bash
~Liquor Preference
~Mood
~Random
```
